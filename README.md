What is UnickTrust | Food|Del?
UnickTrust | Food|Del is a powerful full-stack platform designed to digitally transform how hotels and restaurants manage daily operations—from digital menus and order processing to stock management and payment automation. Developed entirely using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), the platform reflects modern best practices in web development, scalability, and user-centered design.

Built with responsiveness and performance in mind, the platform includes a mobile-first customer interface that allows users to browse digital menus, place orders, and track the preparation and delivery process in real time. This not only improves the customer experience but also fosters greater transparency and engagement between staff and guests.

Admin & Staff Dashboard for Hotels and Restaurants
The system includes a robust and intuitive admin dashboard, purpose-built for the food and hospitality industry. Managers and staff can:

Add, edit, or remove menu items on the fly

Monitor incoming orders and kitchen activity

Receive low-stock alerts and restock efficiently

Set role-based permissions for team members

Access real-time data analytics to guide decision-making

Inventory & Stock Management System
One of UnickTrust Food|Del’s most powerful features is its automated stock management module, which tracks inventory in real-time. This system helps reduce waste, avoid ingredient shortages, and ensure kitchen operations run smoothly — a critical need for both high-end hotels and fast-paced restaurants.

Secure Payment Integration
UnickTrust Food|Del supports Stripe-powered online payments, allowing businesses to process transactions securely and efficiently. This not only reduces reliance on cash but also accelerates the checkout process, creating a safer and more convenient payment flow for both customers and staff.
